# Snort Intrusion Prevention 

Explore how to detect and prevent malicious activity using Snort!, weâ€™ll investigate traffic data and stop attacks under two different scenarios. The goal is to use Snort to analyze live and captured traffic while creating rules to thwart malicious behavior.

## Steps

### 1. The Machine is Under Attack!

First, weâ€™ll use Snort in **logger mode** to capture network activity. Let it run for about a minute to capture a brute-force attack. Once stopped, a log file should be created.

### 2. Viewing Captured Logs

To analyze the captured logs, we can read the log file. This will display detailed packet data. For example, in this capture, we detected **9,948 packets** in total.

### 3. Identify Ports Under Attack

#### Find the IP Address of the Machine
We locate the machine's IP address by checking its network configuration.

#### Analyze the Logs
Switching back to the logs, we observed attempts on **port 80 (HTTP)** and **port 22 (SSH)**.

### 4. Filter Traffic by Ports

#### Filter Traffic for Port 22
To narrow down the traffic, we filtered packets for port 22.

We identified **2,872 packets** related to port 22.

#### Filter Traffic for Port 80
Similarly, filtering traffic for port 80 revealed **7,049 packets**.

---

### 5. Investigate Port 22

After closely inspecting the first 10 packets for port 22, we noticed persistent communication patterns indicative of a brute-force attack.

![Analyzing packets](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/aa19e988-e207-4d60-9783-e15472d1e014)

We ruled out port 80 traffic, as it seemed to be regular browsing activity. The constant communication on port 22 confirmed it as the target of the attack.

### 6. Stopping the Attack

#### Create Rules to Block Traffic
To stop the brute-force attack, we crafted a rule to drop all packets targeting port 22, regardless of the source or destination.

The rule added to the configuration blocks malicious traffic targeting port 22.

### 7. Run Snort in IPS Mode

We enabled **IPS mode** to actively block the malicious traffic, successfully stopping the attack.

## Success!

The brute-force attack on port 22 was successfully stopped. ðŸŽ‰

## Conclusion

This project demonstrates how to use Snort for real-time intrusion prevention by analyzing network traffic, identifying threats, and deploying effective rules. Snort's versatility makes it a powerful tool for defending against network attacks. ðŸš€
